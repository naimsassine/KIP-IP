The kidney assignment problem is a real life situation that many patients face on a daily basis. In fact the preferred treatment for kidney failure is transplantation. However, the demand for donor kidneys is far greater than the supply. So, for a certain patient, finding a matching donor, which needs to have some tissue-type compatibility can require sometimes a tremendous job. In fact, the act of deceased donation is called kidney exchange, which allows patients with a willing but medically incompatible living donor to swap their donor with other patients. The process is generalisable to more than two pairs, forming cycles of compatible transplants. The problem now is finding the matching pairs, and cycles, of patients and donors, to maximize the compatibility, as well as undergoing certain constraints. 
The aim of this assignment is to solve the kidney assignment problem via Integer Programming techniques, with the goal of maximizing the success rate of the transplantations overall.
